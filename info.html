        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
        Jackson McAvoy and Naomy Chepngeno Chesengeny founded Favtune way back in September 2023. Although they barely knew each other, 
        it was both of their lifelong dreams to create a unique, stylized experience for rating songs and sharing ratings with friends.
        Through chance alone, they were tasked as partners for a classroom project. It was then that they came together and created Favtune. 
        Since then, they have ammased over 6 users, paving their way into the industry.<br>
            
        Our mission is to optimize your music rating experience. With Favtune, you can explore a vast collection of songs, rate them, and keep your music library organized. 
        Whether you're a music aficionado or just looking for new tracks to groove to, we believe that music brings people together, and Favtune is here to enhance your musical journey.
